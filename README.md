## Description

A remake of [Sygic Travel](https://travel.sygic.com), visitors can click on a city and see tourist attractions in that city, ranked by prominence. Visitors can also click on the filter navigation links to sort into restaurants, libraries, museums, and more. To plan a trip, visitors can sign in, enter their trip details, and then start planning their itineraries for each day of their holiday by adding attractions to their trip. Vendor accounts have the ability to create "Tours" which, ultimately, visitors will be able to view, review, and 'buy.' Cloney Island also has admin accounts that can sign up vendors, disable user accounts, and access high level stats about users.
